EcoIndex.fr was designed to compare URL of the same type, for example: comparing the "article page" of several news websites, or homepages of different institutional websites. Our calculation engine is not able to automatically detect the type of page or URL analyzed. Some types of websites usually tend to have higher impact than others. Therefore, we must compare what is comparable, for example: it would make no sense to put Amazon's homepage side-by-side with an article page published on the New York Times website.
