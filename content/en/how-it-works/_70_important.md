Unlike other analysis services using a headless browser, with EcoIndex.fr, page loading, creation and display in the browser are not simulated. There is no difference with what actually happens in your browser.

Tests are limited to 10 per day for the same domain name. This limits usage abuse, avoids server overload, and makes EcoIndex.fr accessible to everyone, at any time.
However, if you'd like to run more frequent tests, you can use other tools [available on GitHub](https://github.com/cnumr)
