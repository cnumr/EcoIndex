### Physical footprint

The webstite's physical footprint is characterized, notably, by the amount of Random Access Memory (RAM) and the number of processor (CPU) cycles consumed by the process of the browser displaying the analysed URL. Analysing physical footprint over time - evolution of RAM consumption and CPU load - allows us to identify correlations and treshold effects: CPU blocking, RAM overconsumption...

A webpage environmental footprint is depicted by its equivalence in terms of **greenhouse gases emissions and water consumption for a given number of visitors**. It is calculated according to the website's ecodesign level. We start from an average impact in terms of GHG emissions and fresh water consumption, stemming from several models carried out by GreenIT.fr: this average impact is **2g CO2e and 3cl blue water per webpage**. Calculation of this value is based on the results of a LCA (Life Cycle Analysis), from end-to-end (from terminal to server), accounting for the complete life cycle (manufacture and usage) of a webpage (processing, transporting and displaying). This average value is nuanced according to the tested webpage ecodesign level, meaning that, **depending on the EcoIndex score obtained, we overvalue or undervalue the average value**. These results have been verified by third parties and are consistent with results obtained by other independent models. In this first version, the analysis is based on an **ADSL connection from a landline**.
