EcoIndex.fr is an online service initially designed by Frédéric Bordage (GreenIT.fr) and produced by Gwenael Chailleu and Thomas Samain (Nxtweb).
Subsequently, many volunteer contributors participated in the developments and improvements of the online service. This collective project, open to all, is hosted on the Green IT collective repositories here: https://github.com/cnumr/EcoIndex and https://github.com/cnumr/EcoIndex_python
