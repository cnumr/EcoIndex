To give you an idea, **1kg CO2e** is similar to driving about **3km by car**.
Taking a shower consumes an average of 6 liters of water per minute.

If your webpage emits **1.7g CO2e** and consumes **2.5cl of water**, it means that for 1000 monthly visitors, its footprint  is **1.7kg CO2e and 25l of water**: similar to driving a car 5.5km and taking a 4 minutes shower.
