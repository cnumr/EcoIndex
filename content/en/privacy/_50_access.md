The Ecoindex tool is a technical tool whose algorithm is openly explained on the site. It aims to give an initial indication of the performance and environmental footprint of a URL, based on the information information present in the code of this URL. By analysing the URLs making up the digital service (website, etc.) EcoIndex.fr can be used to reconstruct the environmental impacts associated with a typical route. The tool and the the results of queries, may not be used for any other purpose, in particular for commercial, advertising or comparative advertising.

Its use is free, but subject to conditions. Please respect them. The Ecoindex tool must not be used in an abusive, illicit or illegitimate manner. In particular, it is forbidden to script EcoIndex.fr, i.e. to automate the sequence of analyses.
