We collect information about the URL written in our test bar and we store them in our database. The information collected is as follows:

- URL, weight of the page tested, number of requests of the page tested, number of the DOM elements in the page tested.
- This information is stored with no time limit in order to enable comparisons over time in case of subsequent request on the same URL, which seems to us to be relevant data for analysis and follow-up.
- This information is hosted by the service provider described in [legal](/en/legal/).
- The information collected are only used to calculate the environmental performance of the page tested and to populate a database on the current state of the URL tested by the users.
