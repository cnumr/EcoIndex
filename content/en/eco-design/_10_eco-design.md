Eco-designing a website means taking into account its environmental impact at each stage of its life cycle: from specs, to functional and graphic design, to final use, including developement and maintenance. It's a global way of thinking (and working!)

Eco-design aims to question every digital trades, for the better: in addition to its positive impact for the environment, it also improves efficiency of digital services.
Many tools and good practices are available to guide you on this virtuous path.

The eco-design approach of a digital service is based on 5 fundamentals:

- Definition of the service's **functional unit**: i.e. its main function for the user, as an action (for exemple: "buying a train ticket" or "consulting its bank account weekly")
- Assessing the environmental impact of **every equipment necessary** for the service implementation...
- ... for **every stage of its life cycle** (manufacture, use, end of life)...
- ... according to **several environmental indicators** (resources depletion, water consumption, pollutant emissions...)!
- Following a process of constant improvement, prioritizing main levers of improvement first.
