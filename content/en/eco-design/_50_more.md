## Beyond eco-design

Eco-design of digital services alone cannot significantly reduce global digital footprint. Other simple measures, against the current of our society unrestrained growth, must be implemented to change the actual trajectory.

- **Reducing connected devices number** by promoting **pooling and substitution**, for example: using a centralized device to operate all the modems of one building. We can also **open their API** to extend their lifespan - API are programming interfaces notably used to exchange data between connected devices and servers of manufacturers or thier partners.
- **Reducing flat screens number** by switching them with other display devices : VR headset, LED video projectors... And above all good books and quality time with family and friends, away from screens ;-)
- **Increasing devices lifespan** by extending legal warranty period, promoting reuse and fighting against some economic models (particularly mobile phones operators).
